## 🚀 Getting Started with Development

1. **Upload a Video**: Click "Choose Video File" to select a video
2. **Edit**: Use the controls to trim, mute, or add text overlays
3. **Preview**: See your changes reflected in the player
4. **Process**: Click "Process Video" to simulate editing
5. **Download**: Get your edited video result

## 📝 Notes

- This is a frontend-focused implementation with simulated backend operations
- Video processing is mocked for demonstration purposes
- For production use, integrate with a video processing service
- All state is managed client-side using Zustand
